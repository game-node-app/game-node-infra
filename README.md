# game-node-infra
Configuration for NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager) our proxy service of choice.

### Security
NPM should not be used in a public/shared network of containers, rather, it should be in a network with only the services it actually exposes.

### Important
If you are looking to contribute in GameNode, this is probably not the repository you are looking for.  
Take a look at [game-node-web](https://github.com/game-node-app/game-node-web) and [game-node-server](https://github.com/game-node-app/game-node-server) instead.
